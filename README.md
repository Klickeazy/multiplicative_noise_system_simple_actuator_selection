# Analysis of Actuator Selection for Discrete-time Linear systems with Multiplicative Noise

We propose a multi-metric greedy algorithm for selection of actuator sets for discrete-time linear systems with multiplicative noise in network dynamics and the actuator control inputs. For a noisy true system, we compare actuator selection and the corresponding optimal feedback control costs for a nominal model and for a multiplicative noise model (with parametric errors).
